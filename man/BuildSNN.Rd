  reduction.type = "pca", dims.use = NULL, k.param = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{genes.use}{A vector of gene names to use in construction of SNN graph
if building directly based on expression data rather than a dimensionally
reduced representation (i.e. PCs).}

\item{reduction.type}{Name of dimensional reduction technique to use in
construction of SNN graph. (e.g. "pca", "ica")}

\item{dims.use}{A vector of the dimensions to use in construction of the SNN
graph (e.g. To use the first 10 PCs, pass 1:10)}

\item{k.param}{Defines k for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm}

\item{plot.SNN}{Plot the SNN graph}

\item{prune.SNN}{Sets the cutoff for acceptable Jaccard distances when
computing the neighborhood overlap for the SNN construction. Any edges with
values less than or equal to this will be set to 0 and removed from the SNN
graph. Essentially sets the strigency of pruning (0 --- no pruning, 1 ---
prune everything).}

\item{print.output}{Whether or not to print output to the console}

\item{distance.matrix}{Build SNN from distance matrix (experimental)}

\item{force.recalc}{Force recalculation of SNN.}

\item{filename}{Write SNN directly to file named here as an edge list compatible with FindClusters}

\item{save.SNN}{Default behavior is to store the SNN in object@snn. Setting to FALSE can be used
together with a provided filename to only write the SNN out as an edge file to disk.}

\item{k.scale}{Granularity option for k.param}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite existing SNN graph?}
}
\value{
Returns the object with object@snn filled
}
\description{
Constructs a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph for a given dataset. We
first determine the k-nearest neighbors of each cell (defined by k.param *
k.scale). We use this knn graph to construct the SNN graph by calculating the
neighborhood overlap (Jaccard distance) between every cell and its k.param *
k.scale nearest neighbors (defining the neighborhood for each cell as the
k.param nearest neighbors).

pbmc_small
# Compute an SNN on the gene expression level
