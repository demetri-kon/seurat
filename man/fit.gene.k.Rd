\title{Build mixture models of gene expression}
\usage{
fit.gene.k(object, gene, do.k = 2, num.iter = 1, do.plot = FALSE,
  genes.use = NULL, start.pct = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{gene}{Gene to fit}

\item{do.k}{Number of modes for the mixture model (default is 2).  When
\code{do.k} is set greater than 2, it cannot co-exist with parameter
\code{start.pct}.}

\item{num.iter}{Number of 'greedy k-means' iterations (default is 1)}

\item{do.plot}{Logic. Plot mixture model results if TRUE.}

\item{genes.use}{Genes to use in the greedy k-means step. (Default: landmark
genes. See manuscript for details)}

\item{start.pct}{(Optional) Initial estimates of the percentage of cells in
the 'on' state (usually estimated from the in situ map). Cannot co-exist with
\code{do.k}.  When \code{start.pct} is used, it is assumed that only 2 states
exisits and in the same time \code{do.k} is forced to be 2.}
}
\value{
A Seurat object, where the posterior of each cell being in the 'on'
or 'off' state for each gene is stored in \code{object@mix.probs}
}
\description{
Models the imputed gene expression values as a mixture of gaussian
distributions. For a two-state model, estimates the probability that a given
cell is in the 'on' or 'off' state for any gene. Followed by a greedy
k-means step where cells are allowed to flip states based on the overall
structure of the data (see Manuscript for details)
